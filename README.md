A holonomic constraint provides an inherently global geometrical constraint on motion in the sense of being specified everywhere, but not in the sense of demanding internal global coordination of variables.

Holonomic or configuration constraints reduce the degrees of freedom (dofs) of a robot, whereas nonholonomic constraints reduce the space of possible velocities.
